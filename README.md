## Welcome to Ben's Boardgame Bazaar!

### Find the hosted version of this site here: https://bensboardgamebazaar.netlify.app/

This is the front-end for my boardgame review website, an ongoing project that allows users to see short boardgame reviews, upvote/downvote them and comment. You can see other user comments and coming soon you will be able to take on the role of other users and make comments under their name.

After clicking on See All Reviews, you'll be able to look through them page by page, as well as sort by date, number of comments and votes, all in either ascending or decending. You can also filter by a variety of categories with the drop down menu on the left.

### The data for this site can be found in my backend API: https://github.com/retcon1/nc-games
